In this course, you will learn the ins and outs of JavaScript's core concepts and syntax. We will touch on both HTML and CSS, but that is not the main focus of this course.

The goal of this course is to introduce you to the wonders of web development! The course is fast-paced compared to some of our other courses and is not necessarily beginner-friendly.

If you are just starting in your programming journey I recommend checking out our C++ 101 course!

## Necessary Software:
To complete this course, you will need to install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download) to run the JavaScript in the terminal.

Of course, you will need a text editor as well and as always, I recommend VS Code.
