Throughout this course, we will be putting our C++ skills to the test to learn various custom data structures and algorithms. If you do not have a firm understanding of C++, I highly recommend you take the intro to C++ course! This will help a lot.

Topics covered in this course:
- Basic Structures (linked lists, stacks, queues, heaps, trees, etc)
- Basic Algorithms (binary search, linear search, quicksort, heap sort, etc)
- Program Complexity (both space and time)
